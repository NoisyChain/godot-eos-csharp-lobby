# godot-eos-csharp-lobby
A Lobby system made for Godot 4 using EOS C# SDK

## Why did you make this?
Glad you asked!
My main goal with this is just to be a personal challenge of mine. Even with a bunch of addons for Gdoot that do the same thing, I think it's pretty cool to be able to make the C# version of the SDK work flawlessly with Godot.

Another reason is because the addons out there, like most GDExtension projects, are more worried about making it work with GDScript. This one, on the other hand, is made especially for C#, since C# is my main language.
